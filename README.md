# Scratch to Phonegap

This repo is for people who want to make mobile apps using Scratch. No programming experience beyond Scratch. See the tutorial here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116055504/

This method uses Phoshporus, a Scratch to JS compiler, and PhoneGap, a JS to mobile app compiler. If you follow my setup, you will never need to push updates to the mobile app, just the Scratch project. The app will always play the current version of the project found on Scratch.

For reference if you follow any other PhoneGap tutorials to further customize your app, this repository contains the entirety of Phosphorus source code (which is set to run your Scratch project) and the PhoneGap config.xml. If a tutorial says to add or edit any files, feel free to do so.

Good luck! :)
